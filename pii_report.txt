File: dummy6.py
PII Detected: Here is the JSON response based on the provided code:

```json
[
    {
        "line_number": 12,
        "pii_type": "NAME",
        "third_party": "thirdpartydb.com",
        "context": "cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO pii_data (name, email) VALUES (%s, %s)\", (pii_data[\"name\"], pii_data[\"email\"]))"

File: dummy4.py
PII Detected: To identify instances where Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is shared with third-party entities in the provided code, we need to analyze the code for any occurrences where PII fields are written to an external file, sent to an external API, or logged in a manner that could be accessed by third parties.

Here's the provided code for reference:
```python
# Mock PII Data
pii_data = {
    "name": "Bob Johnson",
    "email": "bob.johnson@example.com",
    "address": "123 Main St, Cityville, ST 12345"
}

# Writing PII data to a file to share with a third party
with open("third_party_shared_data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(pii_data))
```

Based on the provided code, we can see that PII data is being written to a file named `third_party_shared_data.txt`. This file is intended to be shared with a third party, as indicated by the comment.

Let's identify the PII fields being shared and generate the JSON response accordingly.

### Analysis
1. **Line 2-6**: Defines the PII data, including "name" and "email".
2. **Line 9-11**: Writes the PII data to a file intended for third-party sharing.

### JSON Response
We will create a JSON response for each identified instance of PII being shared.

```json
[
    {
        "line_number": 10,
        "pii_type": "NAME",
        "third_party": "file: third_party_shared_data.txt",
        "context": "file.write(str(pii_data))"
    },
    {
        "line_number": 10,
        "pii_type": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
        "third_party": "file: third_party_shared_data.txt",
        "context": "file.write(str(pii_data))"
    }
]
```

### Explanation
- **Line Number**: 10 (where the PII data is written to the file).
- **PII Type**: "NAME" and "EMAIL_ADDRESS" (both are part of the `pii_data` dictionary).
- **Third Party**: The file `third_party_shared_data.txt` is intended for third-party sharing.
- **Context**: The code snippet `file.write(str(pii_data))` shows the action of writing PII data to the file.

This JSON response captures the instances of PII data being shared with a third party as per the provided code.

--------------------------------------------------

File: dummy1.py
PII Detected: Here is the JSON response based on the provided code:

```json
[
    {
        "line_number": 9,
        "pii_type": "NAME",
        "third_party": "thirdpartyapi.com",
        "context": "response = requests.post(\"https://thirdpartyapi.com/share\", json=pii_data)"
    },
    {
        "line_number": 9,
        "pii_type": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
        "third_party": "thirdpartyapi.com",
        "context": "response = requests.post(\"https://thirdpartyapi.com/share\", json=pii_data)"
    },
    {
        "line_number": 9,
        "pii_type": "PHONE_NUMBER",
        "third_party": "thirdpartyapi.com",
        "context": "response = requests.post(\"https://thirdpartyapi.com/share\", json=pii_data)"
    }
]
```

Explanation:
- The PII data (name, email, and phone) is being shared with a third-party API at "https://thirdpartyapi.com/share".
- This sharing occurs on line 9 of the code.
- The context provided is the line of code where the sharing happens.

--------------------------------------------------

File: dummy5.py
PII Detected: Here's the analysis of the provided code to identify instances where Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is shared with third-party entities:

```python
import boto3

# Mock PII Data
pii_data = {
    "name": "Emily Davis",
    "ssn": "123-45-6789"
}

# Simulating uploading PII data to AWS S3 (third party)
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.put_object(Bucket='third-party-bucket', Key='pii_data.json', Body=str(pii_data))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Line 6**: The `pii_data` dictionary contains a field `"name"` which is a type of PII (NAME).
2. **Line 10**: The `s3.put_object` method uploads the `pii_data` to an AWS S3 bucket, which is a third-party service.

### JSON Response:

```json
[
    {
        "line_number": 6,
        "pii_type": "NAME",
        "third_party": "AWS S3",
        "context": "pii_data = {\n    \"name\": \"Emily Davis\",\n    \"ssn\": \"123-45-6789\"\n}"
    },
    {
        "line_number": 10,
        "pii_type": "NAME",
        "third_party": "AWS S3",
        "context": "s3.put_object(Bucket='third-party-bucket', Key='pii_data.json', Body=str(pii_data))"
    }
]
```

In this case, the PII field `"name"` is identified and shared with AWS S3, a third-party service. The JSON response includes the line numbers, the type of PII, the third party involved, and a brief snippet of the code where the sharing occurs.

File: share_non_pii_http.py
PII Detected: Based on the provided code, it seems that there are no instances where Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as PHONE_NUMBER, NAME, EMAIL_ADDRESS, or DATE_OF_BIRTH is being shared with third-party entities. The code only shares non-PII data, specifically a user ID, action, and timestamp, with a third-party API.

Here is the JSON response indicating that no PII sharing was found:

```json
[]
```

If you have any other files or code snippets you would like to scan for PII sharing, please provide them, and I will be happy to assist.

--------------------------------------------------

File: dummy10.py
PII Detected: Based on the provided code, I will scan for instances where Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is shared with third-party entities. The PII fields to check include PHONE_NUMBER, NAME, EMAIL_ADDRESS, and DATE_OF_BIRTH.

Here is the code you provided:
```python
import socket

# Mock PII Data
pii_data = {
    "name": "Lucas Young",
    "email": "lucas.young@example.com"
}

# Simulating sending PII data through a socket to a third party
s = socket.socket()
s.connect(('thirdpartysocket.com', 8080))
s.send(str(pii_data).encode())
s.close()
```

### Analysis:
1. **NAME**: "Lucas Young" is being shared.
2. **EMAIL_ADDRESS**: "lucas.young@example.com" is being shared.
3. **Third Party**: 'thirdpartysocket.com'

### JSON Response:
```json
[
    {
        "line_number": 6,
        "pii_type": "NAME",
        "third_party": "thirdpartysocket.com",
        "context": "pii_data = {\n    \"name\": \"Lucas Young\",\n    \"email\": \"lucas.young@example.com\"\n}"
    },
    {
        "line_number": 6,
        "pii_type": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
        "third_party": "thirdpartysocket.com",
        "context": "pii_data = {\n    \"name\": \"Lucas Young\",\n    \"email\": \"lucas.young@example.com\"\n}"
    },
    {
        "line_number": 11,
        "pii_type": "NAME",
        "third_party": "thirdpartysocket.com",
        "context": "s.send(str(pii_data).encode())"
    },
    {
        "line_number": 11,
        "pii_type": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
        "third_party": "thirdpartysocket.com",
        "context": "s.send(str(pii_data).encode())"
    }
]
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 6**: The PII data is defined in the dictionary `pii_data` containing both NAME and EMAIL_ADDRESS.
- **Line 11**: The PII data is being sent to the third-party socket 'thirdpartysocket.com'.

If there were no instances of PII sharing, the response would be an empty JSON array:
```json
[]
```
